A Lion lay asleep in the forest, his great head resting on his paws. 
A timid little Mouse came upon him unexpectedly, and in her fright and haste to 
get away, ran across the Lion's nose. Roused from his nap, the Lion laid his 
huge paw angrily on the tiny creature to kill her.


"Spare me!" begged the poor Mouse. 
"Please let me go and some day I will surely repay you."

The Lion was much amused to think that a Mouse could ever help him.
 But he was generous and finally let the Mouse go.
